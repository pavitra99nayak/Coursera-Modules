                    Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

                    Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun.

                    C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language.
